    "# Code-Driven Introduction to Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome, this is an example from the book [Reinforcement Learning](https://rl-book.com/?utm_source=winder&utm_medium=notebook&utm_campaign=rl), by Dr. Phil Winder. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook you will be investigating the fundamentals of reinforcement learning (RL). The first section describes the Markov decision process (MDP), which is a framework to help you design problems. The second section formulates an RL-driven solution for the MDP.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook was developed to work in [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) or [Google's colabratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) -- other notebook hosts are available. This allows you to launch your own notebook and tinker around with the code. I expect that you are familiar with a Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also expect that you are familiar with Python, since the code is written in this language.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following examples I intentionally use a very simple and visual example. This makes it easier to understand, since that is the main goal. Although there are [industrial examples](https://rl-book.com/applications/?utm_source=winder&utm_medium=notebook&utm_campaign=rl) that are similar, real-life implementations are likely to be more complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Section 1. The Markov Decision Process\n",
    "\n",
    "The Markov decision process (MDP) is a mathematical framework that helps you encapsulate the real-world. Desptite simple and restrictive -- the sign of a good interface -- a suprising number of situations can be squeezed into the MDP formalism.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The MDP Entities\n",
    "\n",
    "An MDP has two \"entities\":\n",
    "\n",
    "- **An agent**: An application that is able to observe state and suggest an action. It also receives feedback to let it know whether the action was good, or not.\n",
    "- **An environment**: This is the place where the agent acts within. It accepts an action, which alterts its internal state, and produces a new observation of that state.\n",
    "\n",
    "In nearly all of the examples that I have seen, these two entities are implemented independently. The agent is often an RL algorithm (although not always) and the environment is either real life or a simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The MDP Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent and the environment interact through an interface. You have some control over what goes into that interface and a large amount of effort is typically spent improving the quality of the data that flows through it. You need representations of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **State**: This is the observation of the environment. You often get to choose what to \"show\" to the agent. There is a compromise between simplifying the state to speed up learning and preventing overfitting, but often it pays to include as much as you can.\n",
    "- **Action**: Your agent must suggest an action. This mutates the environment in some way. So called \"options\" or \"null-actions\" allow you to do nothing, if that's what you want to do.\n",
    "- **Reward**: You use the reward to fine-tune your action choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a \"GridWorld\" Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it easy to understand, I'm going to show you how to create a simulation of a simple grid-based \"world\". Many real-life implementations begin with a simulation of the real world, because it's much easier to iterate and improve your design with a software stub of real-life.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this environment is to define a \"world\" in which a \"robot\" can move. The so-called-world is actually a series of cells inside a 2-dimensional box. The agent can move north, east, south, or west which moves the robot between the cells. The goal of the environment is to reach a goal. There is a reward of -1 for every step, to promote reaching the goal as fast as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Imports and Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "First let me import a few libraries (to enable the autocompletion in later cells) and define a few important definitions. The first is the defacto definition of a \"point\" object, with x and y coordinates and the second is a direction enumeration. These are use to define the position of the agent in the environment and the direction of movement for an action, respectively. Note that I'm assuming that east moves in a positive x direction and north moves in a positive y direction."

    "- The **reward** fully specifies the optimal solution to the problem. In real life this might be profit or the number of new customers.\n",

    "## A Reinforcement Learning Solution to the MDP: Implementing the Monte Carlo RL Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather confusingly, RL, like ML, is meant both as a technique and a collection of algorithms. Exactly _when_ an algorithm becomes an RL algorithms is up for debate, but it is generally accepted that there has to be multiple steps (otherwise it would just be a bandit problem) and it attempts to quantify the value of being in a particular state.\n",
    "\n",
    "An algorithm called the _cross-entropy method_ is an algorithm that attempts to stumble accross the goal. However, once it has then it replicates the same movements again to reach the goal. This is not stricly learning, it is memoising, so it is not an RL algorithm. However, you shouldn't discount it, because it is a very good and simple baseline. It can easily complete very sophisticated tasks if you give it enough time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, let me introduce a slight variation to this algorithm called the Monte Carlo (MC) method. This lies at the heart of all modern RL algorithms so it is a great way to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short -- you can read more about this in Chapter 2 of the book -- MC methods attempt to randomly sample states and judge their value. Once you have sampled the states enough times then you can derive a strategy that follows the path of the next best value.\n",

    "Let's give it a try.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Monte Carlo techniques operate by sampling the environment. In general, the idea is that if you can sample the environment enough times, you can begin to build a picture of the output, given any input. We can use this idea in RL. If we capture enough _trajectories_, where a trajectory is one full pass through an environment, then we can see which states are advantagous.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, I will create a class that is capable of generating trajectories. Here I pass in the environment, then in the `run` function I repeatedly step in the environment using a random action. I store each step in a list and return it to the user."

    "\n",
    "This obviously means that the actual algorithm isn't that intelligent. For example, MC techniques usually go through two phases, policy evaluation, where full trajectories are captured, then policy improvement, where a new policy is derived. This helps stabilise and speed up learning, beacuse you are learning on every episode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsequent algorithms then take this idea further and update the policy on every _step_, which is called _bootstrapping_ which supercharges the RL algorithm to produce _temporal difference_ algorithms (see Chapter 3 in the book).\n",
    "\n",
    "But I'm getting ahead of myself. I really do encourage you to play around with this code and tinker with the results. Here are some things that you can try:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Increase or decrease the size of the grid.\n",
    "- Add other terminating states\n",
    "- Change the reward to a different value\n",
    "- Change the reward to produce 0 reward per step, and a positive reward for the terminating state\n",
    "- Add a terminating state with a massive negative reward, to simulate a cliff\n",
    "- Add a hole in the middle\n",
    "- Add a wall\n",
    "- See if you can add the code to use the policy derived by the agent\n",
    "\n",
    "And of course, there's far more details in the book. Please [consider buying it](https://rl-book.com/?utm_source=winder&utm_medium=notebook&utm_campaign=rl) if you want to learn more. Good luck!"
